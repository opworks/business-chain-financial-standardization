## 📊 Project Overview

Multi-location businesses struggle with inconsistent financial reporting formats across their portfolio. Each location may use different P&L structures, KPI definitions, and data formats, making consolidated analysis nearly impossible. This project demonstrates a comprehensive solution for standardizing financial data across business chains.

**Problem:** Inconsistent financial reporting across multiple business locations preventing unified KPI analysis  
**Solution:** Automated ETL pipeline for P&L standardization, location mapping, and KPI harmonization  
**Result:** Unified financial reporting enabling portfolio-wide performance analysis and benchmarking

## 🎯 Business Impact

- ⏱️ **Time Savings:** Weeks of manual consolidation reduced to hours of automated processing
- 📈 **KPI Standardization:** Consistent metrics across all locations for meaningful comparisons
- 🎯 **Data Quality:** 100% validation and audit trails for financial accuracy
- 🔄 **Scalability:** Easy addition of new locations and business formats
- 💰 **Portfolio Analysis:** Real-time performance benchmarking across entire business chain
- 📊 **Executive Reporting:** Unified dashboards for strategic decision making

## 🚀 The Challenge

### Multi-Location Financial Chaos
Each business location typically has unique challenges:

```
Location A: Revenue by service type, expenses by category, monthly P&L
Location B: Consolidated revenue, detailed cost centers, quarterly reporting
Location C: Mixed revenue streams, location-specific expenses, annual summaries
Corporate: Consolidated view needed but data formats don't align
```

**Common Issues Encountered:**
- Location-specific revenue categories vs. general expense allocation
- Different chart of accounts across locations
- Inconsistent time periods and forecast classifications
- Mixed data types and quality across financial systems
- Manual consolidation taking weeks per reporting period

## 💡 Solution Architecture

### 1. Location-Aware Financial Mapping
```python
def is_location_specific_field(self, field_name):
    """Intelligent field categorization for multi-location businesses"""
    location_specific_fields = [
        "Location A Revenue", "Location B Revenue", 
        "Location C Revenue", "Corporate Revenue"
    ]
    # Determine if revenue belongs to specific location or general expenses
```

### 2. Dynamic P&L Transformation
```python
def create_raw_data_records(self, df_raw, date_info, categories_with_rows):
    """Transform complex P&L structures into standardized format"""
    for location_key, location_name in self.business_locations.items():
        # Apply location-specific business rules
        # Separate location revenue from shared expenses
        # Maintain data integrity across transformations
```

### 3. Multi-Client Harmonization System
```python
def create_client_specific_mapping(self, client_name):
    """Dynamic mapping system for different business formats"""
    # Client-specific column mappings
    # Standardized KPI definitions
    # Business-rule validation
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Processing Engine: `raw_data_etl.py`

This script handles the complex transformation of location-specific P&L data into standardized formats.

#### **Intelligent Location Mapping**
```python
def should_include_field_for_location(self, field_name, current_location_key):
    """Sophisticated business logic for financial data allocation"""
    is_location_specific, field_location = self.is_location_specific_field(field_name)
    
    if is_location_specific:
        # Location-specific revenue: only include if it matches current location
        return field_location == current_location_key
    else:
        # General expenses: allocate to "Corporate" category only
        return current_location_key == "Corporate"
```

#### **Dynamic Date and Forecast Classification**
```python
def find_date_headers(self):
    """Advanced date parsing with forecast type classification"""
    for col_offset, cell in enumerate(row_data):
        parsed_date = pd.to_datetime(cell, errors='coerce')
        forecast_type = "FORECAST" if parsed_date > datetime(2025, 6, 30) else "ACTUAL"
        # Create comprehensive date metadata for time-series analysis
```

#### **Financial Data Integrity Validation**
```python
def show_summary(self, raw_data_df):
    """Comprehensive validation suite for financial accuracy"""
    # Verify location-specific vs general field distribution
    # Cross-check totals and subtotals for mathematical accuracy
    # Audit trail generation for compliance requirements
```

### Multi-Client Harmonization: `normalized_raw_data.py`

Advanced system for standardizing financial data across different business chain formats.

#### **Client-Specific Business Rules**
```python
def create_client_specific_mapping(self, client_name):
    """Dynamic mapping system adapts to each business chain's structure"""
    client_fixes = {
        'Business Chain A': {
            'Total - Revenue': 'Total Revenue',  # Standardize naming
        },
        'Business Chain B': {
            'Location Revenue': 'Total Revenue',  # Map to standard KPI
        }
    }
    # Apply business-specific transformation rules
```

#### **Advanced Data Type Handling**
```python
def create_normalized_output_with_verification(self, combined_df):
    """Robust data processing with comprehensive verification"""
    financial_columns = ['Total Revenue', 'Total Expenses', 'EBITDA']
    
    if normalized_col in financial_columns:
        # Financial data - always convert to numeric with validation
        numeric_data = pd.to_numeric(source_data, errors='coerce')
        # Report and handle data quality issues
```

### Master Processing Pipeline: `raw_data_processor.py`

Production-ready system for processing entire business chain portfolios.

#### **Scalable File Processing**
```python
def run_processing(self):
    """Enterprise-grade processing for multiple business locations"""
    # Load and validate all financial files
    # Apply client-specific business rules
    # Generate comprehensive audit reports
    # Output standardized KPI datasets
```
